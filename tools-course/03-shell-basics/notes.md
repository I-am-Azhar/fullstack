# Safety Notes

## Why rm -rf is dangerous
rm -rf deletes folders and their contents recursively without any warning.
A small mistake like running it in the wrong directory can delete important files or even the entire system.

## Why to avoid unnecessary sudo
sudo gives full system-level permissions. Running commands with sudo when not required can accidentally modify or delete system files, break configurations, or cause security risks.
